# Cifar-10---NN---CNN
Keras image classification data, Cifar 10 has been compared with two Model, one with NN and another with CNN. And the result we got is surprising.

CNN accuracy on unseen test Data - 69.68%
NN accuracy on unseen test Data - 48.82%.

--for CNN i started with 50 epochs but interrupt the kernal after 15 epochs as it was taking lot of time, and as the training accuracy has started fluctuating between 74.2 - 74.8 %
